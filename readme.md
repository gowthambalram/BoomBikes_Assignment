## General Information
- **Objective**: Predict the demand for shared bikes to assist the company in optimizing their operations and improving service availability.
- **Data Utilization**: Utilizes historical data on bike usage, including weather conditions, user demographics, and temporal factors.
- **Strategic Outcome**: Enable the company to manage inventory better, adjust pricing, and enhance customer satisfaction during varying economic conditions.

## Conclusions
- **Yearly Increase**: The analysis indicates a noticeable increase in bike bookings from 2018 to 2019, suggesting growing popularity or improved service offerings.
- **Seasonal Demand**: The highest demand for bike rentals occurs in September and October, with consistent high usage from April through August, highlighting key periods for targeted marketing and resource allocation.
- **Environmental Impact**: Factors such as temperature (temp and atemp), humidity (hum), and clear weather conditions show a positive correlation with the number of bike rentals. These findings underscore the importance of weather-adaptive business strategies.
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Data shows that customers prefer renting bikes when the weather is clear, and there is a slight increase in rentals during summer and winter, suggesting the influence of weather conditions on customer behavior.

These insights are instrumental for the company to strategically plan and adapt their operations to meet demand efficiently and effectively, enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing revenue opportunities.
